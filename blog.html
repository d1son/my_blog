			<h1>First Week of RCB 10/26-11/02</h1>
			<p> The first week of RCB class was very interesting. I was suprised to see that people with all different types of working experiences, age, backgrounds were in my class. Although we may all come from different paths in our lives, we all have a common goal. To become highly skilled, full-stack developers. The first class was easy to understand, but the following classes quickly picked up the pace. Shamoon mentioned that the pace will be fast and it will keep us on our toes, which I liked. It makes me want to learn more outside of class, and figure things out on my own using the internet, rather than having Shamoon and the TAs holding my hand and guiding me through the course step by step. Although that would make the content much easier to understand and grasp, I like the fact that I am challenged outside of class. Afterall, when we become full-stack developers we won't have Shamoon's and the TA's awesome guidance anymore. I feel like learning this way will better prepare us for the real world. The first week came and went in the blink of an eye, and even though it seemed like a flash, I am pretty impressed with myself with the amount of coding I picked up within just one week. I know it'll only get harder from here, and I will give it all I've got, but so far, I'm loving the class. I can't wait to see what week 2 has in store for me.</p>
